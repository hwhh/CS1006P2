# Backgammon

Due to the fact that we used IntelliJ for formating the game, a simple build file
could not be generated.

If you would wish to build the project, it will be necessary for it to be imported
into IntelliJ.

For testing purposes, a jar file was provided with the latest build of the project,
which can be run as follows:
    `java -jar Backgammon.jar`
